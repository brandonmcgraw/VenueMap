VenueMap
========

A tool for creating a simple map-based iPhone app using Microsoft Excel and a healthy amount of copy and paste.

========

When I was getting started with my first app, Landmarks, I relied on a ton of sample code and reference to pull together a working proof of concept. As a part of blowing-out that concept, I needed a way to quickly enter data for hundreds of pin annotations into an iOS map-based app that opened little webpages I built to show details. 

I defaulted to Microsoft Excel since I had a previous background in it. The result was a way to bypass writing long lines of code and, instead, treat each pin like a row of data that I could then copy and paste the code for.

While Landmarks has grown up, I thought this might serve as a helpful beginner point for someone else looking to build their first map-focused app and so I've built out a little sample project as it's own reference app for you to build on.
